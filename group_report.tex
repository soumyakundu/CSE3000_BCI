\section*{Introduction}

\doublespacing

A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device that provides the brain with a new, non-muscular communication and control channel [3]. The goal of a BCI is to provide a command signal directly form the brain, as that command can serve as a new functional output to control disabled body parts or physical devices, such as computers or robotic limbs [4]. Therefore, such a technology has tremendous potential to help those whose injuries have left them with a functioning central nervous system that can no longer control the actions of the peripheral nervous system [1].

However, there are numerous ethical concerns regarding the rapid development of BCI technologies. Implants are already being developed to replace damaged parts of the brain: two-way communication between brain and computer, bypassing the senses, is already becoming a reality. As the line between ourselves and our devices is blurred, we believe this poses unprecedented ethical and security questions. Do we maintain agency if part of our thinking is computer-regulated? Might humans become hackable?

For the first time in the history of our species, we will have the ability to integrate technology directly into our physiology. While this ability can immensely improve our understanding of the human brain and the lives of those with nervous system disorders, the social implications of this technology in the long run are vastly unknown and should be a subject of great debate.

\section*{Group Report}

\doublespacing

The presentation of this topic led to numerous interesting points that were raised and eventually discussed. We started the presentation with a short video clip featuring SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk explaining how he believes that increasing the bandwidth between our brain and the computer-based devices that we use is an important goal for the current generation of engineers, researchers, and scientists. This led us to the introduction of our topic of BCIs as one example of technology that can accomplish this goal of seamless communication between humans and computers.

First, we talked about current applications of BCI technology. We used a short video clip featuring theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku to introduce the concept of using BCIs to help parapalegics. When asked if they had ever experienced sleep-paralysis, most members of the audience indicated that they did, which allowed us to make a strong connection to those suffering from locked-in syndrome, which results in a state of living similar to perpetual sleep-paralysis, as the patient is conscious but retains little to no control of their muscles. Furthermore, this allowed us to make a strong case for the current application of BCI technology, as this technology can allow such patients to take advantage of communication and control channels with computers that allow them to perform simple tasks on a computer, providing them with a little bit of autonomy in a life where they are mostly left at the mercy of their care-givers.
